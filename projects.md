[https://github.com/TuanTNG/Cybercore-Head-Pose-Estimation](https://github.com/TuanTNG/Cybercore-Head-Pose-Estimation)
*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a machine-learning engineer*
* **Time**: May 2020 -- Jul. 2020
* **Role**: Major contributor of a team of 2 members leaded by [Mr. Khai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nqkhai1706/?originalSubdomain=vn), where I were responsible for reading, implementing SOTA papers and preparing dataset.
