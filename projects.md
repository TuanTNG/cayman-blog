## Rebar-Knot sementic segmentation
*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a Machine learning Engineer*
* **Time**: Jul. 2020 -- now
* **Role**: Team member of a team with 2 members leading by [Thuy Nguyen Chinh](https://thuyngch.github.io/)
* **Description**: This is a project between [CyberCore](http://cybercore.co.jp/) and [Panasonic](https://panasonic.jp/). In this project, I mainly focus on finding out a small model with acceptable accuracy and run at least 10 fps on CPU i5-9400, implementing various loss function and ajust the dataset's labels.
* **Result**: In progress.

## 3D Dangerous Object Detection using Milliwave Radar
*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a Machine learning Engineer*
* **Time**: Jun 2020 -- now
* **Role**: Team member of a team with 6 members leading by [Thuy Nguyen Chinh](https://thuyngch.github.io/) and [Tuan Ho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-ho-4bba81174/?originalSubdomain=vn)
* **Description**: Cooperate with [Taiyo Yuden](https://www.yuden.co.jp/eu/) to develop a security product for early alert at airports. It uses a network of various milliwave radars to detect dangerous objects (e.g., knife, gun) inside clothes.
* **Result**: In progress.

*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a Machine learning Engineer*
* **Time**: May 2020 -- Jul. 2020
* **Role**: Major contributor of a team of 2 members, leaded by [Mr. Khai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nqkhai1706/?originalSubdomain=vn), where I were responsible for reading, implementing SOTA papers and preparing dataset.
* **Description**: We have researched network architechtures and and modify the training dataset to help the network learning easier as well as more statble. This project is a demo of [CyberCore](http://cybercore.co.jp/) delivered to customer in Japan for driver.
* **Result**: The demo video was sent to customer.

*Conducted at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology when I were a student*
* **Time**: Dec. 2019 -- Now
* **Role**: Main contributor of a team of 2 members where I were responsible for reading, implementing SOTA papers for object detection part.
* **Description**: This is my Thesis. Our team researched and applied SOTA algorithms for object detection, tracking and speed estimation of vehicles at the overpass in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. The dataset is collected and labeled by team members. 
* **Result**: On going.

## Implement YOLOv3 from scratch
*Conducted at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology when I were a student*
* **Time**: Dec. 2019 -- Feb. 2020
* **Role**: Research.
* **Description**: Reading YOLOv[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf)/[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf)/[3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf) papers, implementing Neck, Head and Loss Functions of YOLOv3 from scratch using Pytorch.
* **Result**: Stop training at epoch 17 with 0.16 mAP because of limitted GPU resources. For class person only, the model achieved 0.42 in AP.
