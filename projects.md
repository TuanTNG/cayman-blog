## Head Pose Estimation
*Conducted at CyberCore when I were a machine-learning engineer*
* **Time**: May 2020 -- Jul. 2020
* **Role**: Major contributor of a team of 4 members, in which, I were responsible for reading, implementing, and improving SOTA papers.
* **Description**: We have researched techniques to make a network being able to detect unknown objects (not seen in training set and may be harmful if being detected wrongly). This project is a contract between [CyberCore](http://cybercore.co.jp/) and [Toyota Research Institute Advanced Development](https://www.tri-ad.global/) for building a module in autonomous cars.
* **Result**: The project was passed the PoC phase.


## Vehicles detection, tracking and speed estimation
*Conducted at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology when I were a student*
* **Time**: Dec. 2019 -- Now
* **Role**: Main contributor of a team of 2 members where I were responsible for reading, implementing SOTA papers for object detection part.
* **Description**: Our team researched and applied SOTA algorithms for object detection, tracking and speed estimation of vehicles at the overpass in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. The dataset is collected and labeled by team members. 
* **Result**: On going.
